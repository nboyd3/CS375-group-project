# CS375-group-project

proposal:
Our group plan to implement an A* algorithm in java, along with a breadth-first search algorithm, and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. Our experiment will compare each algorithm's speed to get around different obstacles and how different the three algorithms react to different environments. We already have code that implements A* algorithm and will append the code to analyze different environments and the efficiency of these algorithms. The efficiency will be defined as finding the shortest path possible within the least amount of time possible. We plan to track the analysis using the number of times a node is visited from an algorithm and the length of the path. 

Our group will proceed, and divide responsibilities as follows:
- First, we will use Java to create the necessary classes for a graph. This will include a node class that is able to create nodes that hold values and can connect to other nodes. This design will allow us to set values for the algorithms to use. After finishing the implementation, we will go over it as a group so everyone knows how to use it to implement the algorithms.
- Next, each person will be assigned an algorithm to implement. The person implementing A* will use the existing code for help. Breadth-first search and Dijkstras algorithm algorithms will have to be created from scratch. 
- Once each algorithm is implemented, we will combine them and add consistent testing to each. We will create graphs will different obstacles that force the algorithms to take different kinds of paths. Then we will time the algorithms to compare their performances.
- After we get our program working, we will test our code and go over everything as a team to make sure each member understands every algorithm. This will help us when presenting and answering questions.
- Once everyone is on the same page, we will create the presentation and come up with answers to potential questions.
